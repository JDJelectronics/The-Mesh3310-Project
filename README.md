# The-Mesh3310-Project
Make the worlds strongest Node

📱 Mesh3310: The Ultimate Off-Grid Communicator
Mesh3310 is an open-source hardware project dedicated to reviving the legendary Nokia 3310 (Classic) by replacing its obsolete 2G internals with a modern, high-performance PCB.

Our goal is to transform this indestructible icon into a rugged, long-range mesh networking node compatible with Meshtastic and Meshcore.

🚀 The Vision
The Nokia 3310 is famous for its durability, tactile keypad, and ergonomic design. By swapping the original board for our custom PCB, we give it a second life as a decentralized communicator that doesn't rely on cell towers or internet.

⚡ Key Specifications (Draft)
MCU: Nordic nRF52840 (Ultra-low power ARM Cortex-M4F).

LoRa Radio: Semtech SX1272 for long-range communication.

Charging: Integrated USB-C (modernized power delivery).

Display/Input: Full support for the original monochrome LCD and 3x4 keypad.

Firmware: Built to run Meshtastic and Meshcore.

🛠 Project Status: Early Design Phase 🏗️
This project is currently in the initial prototyping stage. We are drafting the schematics and validating component integration.

We are actively seeking contributors! Since we are at the beginning of the journey, your input can directly shape the final hardware.

How you can help:
Hardware Engineering: Reviewing schematics, PCB layout, and RF optimization.

Firmware Development: Porting Meshtastic/Meshcore to work with the legacy LCD and keypad matrix.

Mechanical Design: Ensuring the PCB fits perfectly in original shells and designing internal 3D-printed frames.
